### CS601_TermProject_Robb ###

I developed this React App for the final presentation of this Front End Development CS601 class at Boston University's Metropolitan College Computer Science Department. 

I have a sidebar component with links to the different pages. 
There is a grid layout in use for the pages formatting the sidebar, header, footer and main-content grid-areas.
There is some flex usage with the images in the list items for the hobbies and about pages (renamed to Our 2024 was Busy link).

I found it necessary over time to separate the css out into several different css classes. You can find .css files for App, AboutMe, Hobbies, and Origin.

I was able to get some nice hover effects and buttons thanks to W3schools and GeeksForGeeks examples explaining the content.

There are multiple .json files for data, one to set up some data for site subcribers, and the other to store data and images about my hobbies. 

Fun notes: I debugged about 6 hours trying to get the hobbyList component to render successfully, only to find out a curly brace { } should have been a parentheses (). Fun times. 

All things said above, it should be a relatively smooth experience in navigation with React components. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### CS601_TermProject_Robb ###

I developed this React App for the final presentation of this Front End Development CS601 class at Boston University's Metropolitan College Computer Science Department. 

I have a sidebar component with links to the different pages. 
There is a grid layout in use for the pages formatting the sidebar, header, footer and main-content grid-areas.
There is some flex usage with the images in the list items for the hobbies and about pages (renamed to Our 2024 was Busy link).

I found it necessary over time to separate the css out into several different css classes. You can find .css files for App, AboutMe, Hobbies, and Origin.

There are multiple .json files for data, one to set up some data for site subcribers, and the other to store data and images about my hobbies. 

Fun notes: I debugged about 6 hours trying to get the hobbyList component to render successfully, only to find out a curly brace { } should have been a parentheses (). Fun times.
